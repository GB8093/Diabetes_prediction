Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning 

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on health metrics provided in the PIMA Diabetes dataset. The dataset is processed and analyzed to build a classification model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Standardization of features using StandardScaler to prepare data for modeling.

Machine Learning Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the primary model for prediction.

Model Evaluation: Accuracy is evaluated on both training and test datasets, with results demonstrating reliable performance.

Predictive System: A simple interface is developed to make predictions based on user-provided inputs.


Technologies Used:
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
